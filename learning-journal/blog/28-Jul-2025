# Reclaiming Momentum: Launching My Learning Journal

After several years navigating the early stages of my software engineering career — and life taking a few unexpected turns — I’ve felt an increasing need to reorient myself. Today marks the beginning of that pivot.

I’ve officially launched my new professional GitHub portfolio: [`learning-journal`](https://github.com/your-username/learning-journal). It’s more than a repository; it’s a structured, ongoing record of my continued learning, skills development, and project work as I work toward a long-term goal: contributing meaningfully to the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics, with a focus on exploration technologies.

## Why This Now?

Life changed dramatically when I became the legal guardian of my younger sisters. That shift came with real responsibilities — financial, emotional, and practical — and it meant shelving my original academic plan to pursue a master’s and PhD immediately after undergrad.

But that dream hasn’t disappeared.

If anything, the urgency to keep growing — to continue learning, to create, to contribute — has only grown. This journal is my way of making space for that again, on my own terms, and with full transparency.

## Repository Structure

To ensure this stays well-organized and useful, I’ve structured the repo as follows:


learning-journal/
│
├── projects/ # Practice exercises, learning tasks, experimental builds
├── resources/ # Research papers, notes, and curated reading
├── showcase/ # Portfolio-ready demos and completed smaller projects
├── tools-scripts/ # Automation scripts and utility tools
├── archive/ # Retired or legacy work for reference
├── LICENSE
└── README.md

## 🐜 Capstone Project: Dissertation Reimagined

As the highlight of this journey, I’ll be reworking and completing my undergrad dissertation — a project on **swarm robotics and ant-inspired terrain mapping**, previously left unfinished.

This will be a technical and personal milestone: part redemption arc, part passion project, and a deep dive into AI-driven exploration strategies.

## Focus Areas

- Algorithm design & data structures  
- Python for AI and ML  
- Robotics simulation & control systems  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Geospatial/mapping tools (GIS)  
- Swarm behavior & decentralized systems

## What’s Next?

Over the next few weeks:

- Uploading initial projects & past coursework
- Creating mini-series tutorials or walkthroughs
- Publishing regular learning journal entries
- Designing a visual "skill tree" to map my growth

## Final Thoughts

This repo is more than a portfolio — it’s a commitment. To myself, to my future, and to the kind of technologist I want to become.

If you’re working on something similar or have ideas to share, feel free to connect. I’d love to learn alongside others navigating non-linear tech journeys.

> *Let’s keep building. Let’s keep learning.* 🚀
